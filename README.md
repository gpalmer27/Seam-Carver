# Seam Carver
As part of my Fundamentals of Computer Science II course, I worked with a partner to write a Seam Carver program, where the path with least significance is removed from the image on every tick. With this program, users can press the space bar to start/stop the animation, they can toggle between seeing the image itself and the relative weights of the lines, and they can press the "u" key to reinsert the removed seams.

By instructor policy, source code can be accessed only by request.
